*********************************************************************\
SECRET MESSAGES (messages.py) encrypts or decrypts a message utilizing\
a user-selected cipher from the following list:
   - Atbash Ciper,
   - Caesar Cipher,
   - Keyword Cipher, or
   - Transposition Cipher.

When encrypting, the user can also select the following options:
   - Output the code in five-letter blocks, or
   - Implement a one-time pad.

When decrypting, if the message was encrypted using a one-time pad,\
the user must enter the pad to correctly decrpyt the message.

This program will strip any message of non-alphabetic characters (including\
whitespace) and transform all characters to upper case.\
